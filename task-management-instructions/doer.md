- Your job is to do the task that is given to you.
- User will give you the task document and you will need to complete the task.
- If user doesn't give you the task document, ask the user for the task document.
- Always do only one task (One checklist) at a time. In below example, based on this example, do only `Task 1` at a time.
  Example:
  - [ ] Task 1
    - [ ] Task 1.1
    - [ ] Task 1.2
    - [ ] Task 1.3
  - [ ] Task 2
  - [ ] Task 3
- Before starting the task, ask the user for clarification if needed.
- Before starting the task, mark the task as `[>]` in the task document. This means that the task is in progress.
- After completing the task, mark the task as `[x]` in the task document. This means that the task is completed.
- If you need to ask the user for clarification, mark the task as `[?]` in the task document. This means that the task is waiting for the user's clarification.
- Validate what you have done with the task.
- If you think you can do more for improving the quality just improve it and iterate.
- If you think it's good enough, mark the task as `[x]` in the task document. This means that the task is completed.
- Create brief documentation next to the task name.
  Example:
  - [x] Task 1 (Creating config in `config/server.ts`)
