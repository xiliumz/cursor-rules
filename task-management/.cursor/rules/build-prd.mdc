To build a PRD based on user instructions:

1. Read the `prd-template.md` to understand the required structure, including sections: Product Overview, Objectives, Features (with Dependencies), User Stories, and Non-Functional Requirements.
2. Start with the user's initial instructions for the PRD.
3. For each section in `prd-template.md`:
   - Check if the user's instructions provide sufficient details to fill the section.
   - If details are missing or unclear, prompt the user with a specific question to gather the required information. Examples:
     - For Product Overview: "What is the purpose and key functionality of this product?"
     - For Objectives: "What are the primary goals this product aims to achieve?"
     - For Features: "What specific features should the product include? For each feature, are there any dependencies on other features?"
     - For User Stories: "Can you provide user stories in the format: As a \[user\], I want \[feature\] so that \[benefit\]?"
     - For Non-Functional Requirements: "Are there any performance, security, or scalability requirements?"
4. Continue prompting the user for each section until all required information is provided and no placeholders remain.
5. Once all details are collected, generate the PRD in `standard-prd.md` following the exact structure of `prd-template.md`, filling in the user-provided information.
6. Save the generated PRD in the project root directory as `standard-prd.md`.

Note: If the user provides partial information, store it temporarily and ask only for the missing pieces in subsequent prompts to avoid redundancy.
