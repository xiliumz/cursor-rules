To generate tasks from a standard PRD:

1. Locate the "Features" section in the PRD.
2. Extract the list of features, each with their name, description, and dependencies.
3. Assign a unique task number to each feature, starting from 1, in the order they appear.
4. Create a mapping from feature names to task numbers.
5. For each feature, create a task with:
   - Task number
   - Feature name
   - Description
   - Status: To Do
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: List of task numbers corresponding to the dependent features (using the mapping), or "None" if no dependencies
   - Checklist: Placeholder item
6. Output the tasks in `tasks.md` with the format:

## Task \[Number\]: \[Feature Name\]

Description: \[Feature Description\] Status: To Do Priority: Medium Dependencies: \[List of task numbers or "None"\] Checklist:

- \[ \] (To be determined)
