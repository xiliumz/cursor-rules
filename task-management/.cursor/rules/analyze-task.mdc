To analyze a task for subtasks:

1. Locate the main task in `tasks.md` by its number or name.
2. Read the task description and refer to the original PRD and `standard-prd.md` for context.
3. Determine if the task is complex enough to require subtasks. Consider factors like:
   - Number of features or components involved.
   - Dependencies on other tasks or systems.
   - Estimated time or effort required.
4. If subtasks are needed, generate a list of 3-5 smaller tasks that collectively achieve the main task.
5. Save these subtasks in a new file named `TASK[Number].md` in the `./tasks/` directory, where `[Number]` is the main task's number.
6. Each subtask should have a format similar to the main tasks, including a description, status, priority, and a placeholder checklist.

Example subtask format:

## Subtask 1: \[Subtask Name\]

Description: \[Subtask Description\] Status: To Do Priority: Medium Checklist:

- \[ \] (To be determined)
