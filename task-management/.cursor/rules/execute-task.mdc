To execute tasks:
1. Open `tasks.md` and find the first task (by number) with status "To Do".
2. Check if a subtask file exists in `./tasks/` named `TASK[Number].md`.
   - If yes, open the subtask file and execute each subtask in order:
     a. Perform the actions required for the subtask.
     b. Mark each checklist item as done in the subtask file.
     c. Once all subtasks are completed, update the main task's status to "Completed" in `tasks.md`.
   - If no subtask file exists, execute the main task directly:
     a. Perform the actions required for the main task.
     b. Mark the main task's checklist items as done.
     c. Update the main task's status to "Completed" in `tasks.md`.

Note: When executing tasks, refer to the PRD and other project files for context and implementation details.
